# Jina Workshop @ TUM.ai: Image Search with Pokemons

## Prerequisite

Make sure to install the requirements.
We recommend creating a fresh virtual environment for python (3.7 or 3.8).
There, you can do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You should also download the data and the pre-trained model before the workshop.

Use the following commands:

```
sh ./get_data.sh
sh ./download.sh
```

## During the workshop

Follow along with the [notebook](./flow.ipynb).

Start Jupyter Lab (an improved version of Jupyter Notebook) with `jupyter lab .`
